	  <h1>What is XABSL?</h1>
	  <p>The <em>Extensible Agent Behavior Specification Language</em> XABSL is a very simple language to describe behaviors
	    for autonomous agents based on hierarchical finite state machines. XABSL was developed to design the behavior of soccer robots.
	    Behaviors specified in XABSL proved to be very successful during <a target="_blank" href="http://www.robocup.org">RoboCup</a> since 2004.
	    The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.germanteam.org">GermanTeam</a> has won the competitions in the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tzi.de/spl/">Standard Platform League</a> (using Sony Aibo robots) in 2004, 2005, and 2008. The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dribblers.de">Darmstadt Dribblers</a>
        have won the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tzi.de/humanoid">Humanoid Kid Size</a> competition in 2009 and 2010.
	    However, the usage of the language is not restricted to robotic soccer.
	    XABSL is a good choice to describe behaviors for all kinds of autonomous robots or virtual agents like
	    characters in computer games.

	  <h1>What do you need to use XABSL for your agent?</h1>
	  <p>
	    To start using XABSL for your agent you need only three things:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>A text editor of your choice</li>
	    <li>The XABSL-Compiler (ruby-based)</li>
	    <li>The XabslEngine (C++ or Java library)</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>The behavior is described by a set of .xabsl files.
	    These have to be compiled to an intermediate code using the XABSL-Compiler.
	    At the start-up of the agent this intermediate code is read by the XabslEngine which executes
	    the behavoirs during run-time.</p>
	
	  <h1>How to describe behaviors with XABSL?</h1>
          In XABSL complex behaviors are described as hierarchical finite state machines.
	      To use XABSL, you have to know four concepts: Agents, options, states and decision trees.
	      <h2>Agents</h2>
              In XASBL, an <em>agent</em> consists of a number of behavior modules called
              <em>options</em>. The options are ordered in a rooted directed acyclic
              graph, the <em>option graph</em>.
	      <h2>Options</h2>
	          Options are behavior modules which make up the hierarchical decomposition of the complex agent behavior.
              Lower hierarchy levels consist of primitives behaviors which are composed into more complex behavior
              options.
	      <h2>States</h2>
	          Each option is a finite state machine. The states of an option define the actions that are active. The actions
              of a state can reference other options, thus allowing the decomposition of a task into primitive options.
	      <h2>Decision Trees</h2>
	          The state transitions are defined by decision trees. Decision trees can reference <em>input symbols</em>
              in order to access input data such as the agent's world state or sensory data.

	  <h1>How does it work?</h1>
          <img src="file:option-graph.png" alt=""/>
            The chart to the right shows the option graph of a simple goalie behavior.
            Boxes denote options, ellipses denote basic behaviors. Basic behaviors represent available basic skills.
            The edges show which other option or basic behavior can be activated from
            within an option.<br />
            <br />
            The task of the option graph is to activate and parameterize one of the
            basic behaviors, which is then executed. Beginning from the root option,
            each active option has to activate and parameterize another option on
            a lower level in the graph or a basic behavior.
           </p>
	  <p style="clear:both">
              <img src="file:state-machine.png" alt=""/>
            Within options, the activation of behaviors on lower levels is done by
            state machines. Each state has any number of subsequent options basic
            behaviors. Note that there can be several states that have the same subsequent
            option or basic behavior. <br />
            <br />
            The chart to the right shows the internal state machine of the option
            "goalie-playing". Circles denote states, the circle with the two horizontal
            lines denotes the initial state. An edge between two states indicates
            that there is at least one transition from one state to the other. The
            dashed edges show which other option or basic behavior becomes activated
            when the corresponding state is active.<br />
            <br />
            Each option has an initial state. This state becomes activated when the
            option was not active during the last execution of the option graph. Additionally,
            states can be declared as <em>target states</em>. In the options above
            it can be queried if the subsequent option reached such a target state.
            This helps to check if a behavior was successful.<br />
            <br />
            Additionally, each state can set special requests (<em>output symbols</em>),
            that influence the information processing besides the actions that are
            generated from the basic behaviors. </p>
	  <p style="clear:both">
              <img src="file:decision-tree.png" alt=""/>
            Each state has a decision tree with transitions to other states at the
            leaves. For the decisions the agent's world state, other sensory information
            and messages from other agents can be used. As timing is often important,
            the time how long the state is already active and the time how long the
            option is already active can be taken into account. <br />
            <br />
            The chart to the right shows the decision tree of the state &quot;get-to-ball&quot;.
            The leaves of the tree are transitions to other states. The dashed circle
            denotes a transition to the current state.<br />
            <br />
            <br />
            The <em>execution</em> of the option graph starts from the root option
            of the agent. For each option the state machine is carried out once,
            the decision tree of the active state is executed to determine the next
            active state. This is continued for the subsequent options of the active
            state.</p>
	  <p style="clear:both">
              <img src="file:activation-tree.png" alt=""/>
During behavior execution, the options and basic behaviors that are
activated at a specific time step form a rooted tree which is a subtree of the option graph, the
so called <em>option activation tree</em>. The diagram to the right shows an example option graph
from a simple two-player robot soccer behavior. It depicts the decomposition of the task of
playing soccer into several options and a basic behavior. Boxes represent options, ellipses
represent basic behaviors. The edges show which options might get activated from another option.
The highlighted options, basic behaviors and edges show an example of a possible option activation
tree, showing which behaviors are activated during one specific time step.</p>
	  <p style="clear:both">Agents following this layered state machine architecture
            can be completely described in XABSL. There are language elements for
            options, their states, and their decision trees. Boolean logic (||, &amp;&amp;,
            !, ==, !=, &lt;, &lt;=, &gt; and &gt;=) and simple arithmetic operators
            (+, -, *, / and %) can be used for conditional expressions. Custom arithmetic
            functions (e.g. distance-to(x, y)) that are not part of the language can
            be easily defined and used in instance documents.</p>
	  <p style="clear:both"> <em>Symbols</em> are defined in XABSL instance documents
            to formalize the interaction with the software environment. Interaction
            means access to input functions and variables (e. g. from the world state)
            and to output functions (e. g. to set requests for other parts of the
            information processing). For each variable or function that shall be used
            for conditions a symbol has to be defined. This makes the XABSL architecture and programming language
            independent from specific software environments and platforms.</p>
	  <p style="clear:both">As basic behaviors are implemented externally, prototypes
            and parameter definitions have to be specified in an XABSL document so
            that states can reference them.</p>
